#A company pays its employees as pieceworkers (who work on only one type of item and
#receive a fixed amount of money for each of the items they produce), commission workers
#(who receive $300 plus 6% of their gross weekly sales), hourly-workers (who receive a
#fixed hourly wage up to the first 40 hours they work and 1.25 times their hourly wage for
#overtime hours worked), and managers (who receive a fixed weekly salary). Write a
#program to compute the weekly pay for each employee. You do not know the number of
#the employees in advance. Each type of employee has its own pay-code: Pieceworkers
#have pay-code 1, commission workers have pay-code 2, hourly-workers have a pay-code
#3, and managers have a pay-code 4. Prompt the user to enter the pay-code (-1 to end) of
#the employee and appropriate facts your program needs to calculate the employeeâ€™s
#weekly pay. Print for each entry, the calculated weekly pay of that employee. At the end
#(when user enters -1), display the total weekly pay for all and the total number of
#employees for each type.
